# 📝 To-Do List Web App

This is a simple to-do list web application built while following a tutorial by [GreatStack](https://youtu.be/G0jO8kUrg-I?si=Y_hIAPIurpj2oJak).  
It was one of the first projects I created when learning JavaScript and DOM manipulation. I learned how tasks can be added, marked complete, and deleted dynamically.

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Add new tasks  
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed  
- 🗑️ Delete individual tasks  
- 📄 All actions handled dynamically via JavaScript
